# Kobralost RolePlay - Tools server issues
In this repository, you can see all **issues about the tools (Discord, Dashboard...)**.
It can be a **bug report** or a **feature request**.

## Issues creation and commenting rules
- All your issues need must be **written in English**.
- **Don't use [tags]** in your issues title.
- **Follow the template** and add **more description as possible** for issue creation.
- Make sure an issue **for the same reason does'nt exist before creating another**

## Bug report
- If the bug is an **exploit**, please send a **Discord message to our server manager** instead of creating an issue.

## Feature request

If this is not the case, the issue could be closed.
